Causes

The cause of multiple sclerosis is unknown. It's considered an immune mediated disease in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. In the case of MS, this immune system malfunction destroys the fatty substance that coats and protects nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord (myelin).

Myelin can be compared to the insulation coating on electrical wires. When the protective myelin is damaged and the nerve fiber is exposed, the messages that travel along that nerve fiber may be slowed or blocked.

It isn't clear why MS develops in some people and not others. A combination of genetics and environmental factors appears to be responsible.
Risk factors

These factors may increase your risk of developing multiple sclerosis:

    Age. MS can occur at any age, but onset usually occurs around 20 and 40 years of age. However, younger and older people can be affected.
    Sex. Women are more than 2 to 3 times as likely as men are to have relapsing-remitting MS.
    Family history. If one of your parents or siblings has had MS, you are at higher risk of developing the disease.
    Certain infections. A variety of viruses have been linked to MS, including Epstein-Barr, the virus that causes infectious mononucleosis.
    Race. White people, particularly those of Northern European descent, are at highest risk of developing MS. People of Asian, African or Native American descent have the lowest risk. A recent study suggests that the number of Black and Hispanic young adults with multiple sclerosis may be greater than previously thought.
    Climate. MS is far more common in countries with temperate climates, including Canada, the northern United States, New Zealand, southeastern Australia and Europe. Your birth month may also affect the chances of developing multiple sclerosis, since exposure to the sun when a mother is pregnant seems to decrease later development of multiple sclerosis in these children.
    Vitamin D. Having low levels of vitamin D and low exposure to sunlight is associated with a greater risk of MS.
    Your genes. A gene on chromosome 6p21 has been found to be associated with multiple sclerosis.
    Obesity. An association with obesity and multiple sclerosis has been found in females. This is especially true for female childhood and adolescent obesity.
    Certain autoimmune diseases. You have a slightly higher risk of developing MS if you have other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, pernicious anemia, psoriasis, type 1 diabetes or inflammatory bowel disease.
    Smoking. Smokers who experience an initial symptom that may signal MS are more likely than nonsmokers to develop a second event that confirms relapsing-remitting MS.

Complications

People with multiple sclerosis may also develop:

    Muscle stiffness or spasms
    Severe weakness or paralysis, typically in the legs
    Problems with bladder, bowel or sexual function
    Cognitive problems, like forgetfulness or word finding difficulties
    Mood problems, such as depression, anxiety or mood swings
    Seizures, though very rare
